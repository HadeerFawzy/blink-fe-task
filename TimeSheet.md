NOTES: 
  - I was trying to add Dates Rows but it gave me hard times trying to paginate and it bugged the data while I tried to edit so I had to give up on it after consuming so much time trying! 
  you can check it in earlier commits.
  - I didn't implement the Date Picker only because time not because I don't know, I would have used [https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates]
  - Also the Sort I didn't do it only because of the time but I can do it, Actually mokend does this by passing specific parameter to it so I can change this params from sort function
  - I know how to use Redux but I am not so experieneced using it so it could have delayed me more so I decided not to use it!
  - I am more than HAPPY to hear your FEEDBACK and all your THOUGHTS (Negative or Positive)!
